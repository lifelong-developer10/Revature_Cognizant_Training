      <strong>Urban Development Redefines Modern Living</strong> Urban development across major cities is undergoing a
      significant transformation as governments and private developers focus on sustainable infrastructure and smarter
      living spaces. Modern residential projects are now designed with a balance of comfort, technology, and
      environmental responsibility, ensuring long-term benefits for residents and communities alike.

      <strong>Latest Housing Market News: Price Trends & Stabilization</strong>Housing prices in many urban areas are
      showing signs of stabilizing after a period of rapid growth. Experts note that home price increases have slowed
      down recently, suggesting a shift toward a more balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers dominate. In some
      cities, prices are expected to ease or even dip slightly in the coming year, driven by higher inventory levels,
      modest mortgage rates, and more measured demand.

      <strong>Metro Rail Expansion Approved</strong> The government has officially approved a major expansion of the
      metro rail network aimed at improving urban mobility and reducing road congestion. The new phase of development
      will connect previously underserved residential and industrial areas, making daily travel faster, safer, and more
      affordable for commuters.

      <strong>Chennai Plans 100 Smart Signals by Dec 31</strong>
      Several cities are now introducing smart traffic signals to improve traffic management and reduce congestion.
      These signals use AI, sensors, and cameras to detect real-time traffic flow and dynamically adjust signal timings
      instead of relying on fixed cycles. For example, Ludhiana and Chennai in India are installing smart signals at
      busy intersections.

      <strong>Kolkata Housing Market Sees Sales Drop 12% as New Launches Rise</strong>
      Housing sales in Kolkata declined by about 12 % in 2025 compared with last year, reflecting a slowdown in demand
      across India’s residential property markets amid economic uncertainties and job market pressures. Despite this
      drop in sales, new housing launches surged by 31 %, with most units priced below ₹1.5 crore to attract
      middle‑income buyers and keep affordability in focus. Unsold inventories also climbed, indicating more homes are
      on the market even as demand softens. Industry experts expect the market to recover in 2026 with improved
      regulations, lower interest rates, and renewed buyer confidence.
